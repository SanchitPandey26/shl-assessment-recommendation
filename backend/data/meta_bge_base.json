It consists of hypothetical scenarios, each followed by several possible responses. Candidates rate the effectiveness of each response, using a 6-point scale, from highly undesirable to highly desirable. It can be used for recruitment, selection, training and development, performance management and coaching in a variety of functions and industries. Reports available: Management Scenarios Narrative Report: A participant focused report that contains; - Management Scenarios profile - Detailed narrative feedback of each of the 4 scales; Managerial Judgement, Managing Objectives, People Management and Reputation Management. - Table of scores for each of the 6 style scales; Big picture, Delegative, One-to-one, Team, Personal recognition and Company Protocol. - Detailed narrative feedback report (with development tips) for each of the 6 style scales. Management Scenarios Candidate Report: A report to share with the candidate that contains: - Detailed narrative feedback of each of the 4 scales; Managerial Judgement, Managing Objectives, People Management and Reputation Management. - Table of scores for each of the 6 style scales; Big picture, Delegative, One-to-one, Team, Personal recognition and Company Protocol. - Detailed narrative feedback report (with development tips) for each of the 6 style scales.
